In this question, the challenge was to decode the base64 codes of which only one was the right answer and all others were noise. 
I first decoded each and every base64 code which was given, after which I shortlised the list of possible ones, some of the base64 codes had to be decoded more than once to get the final answer. 
Finally I utilized the clue which was given (Birth of html) which was related to one of the answers that is TIM BERNERS-LEE. He was the creater of Internet and therefore the birth of HTML.
