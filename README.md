My name is Navneeth Dinukumar Menon, I am an S2 student from Computer Science (AI)
I am very much interested in cyber security with a strong inclination towards red teaming, especially in offensive security and real-world attack simulations. I have a solid understanding of Linux fundamentals and I am actively sharpening my skills through hands-on practice. I have been working on OverTheWire Bandit and completed till Level 16. I enjoy exploring vulnerabilities, solving challenges, and continuously learning through practical experimentation. I also know basics of some programming languages like python, C, HTML and CSS but I hope to increase my knowledge in them. Right now I am studing Java as part of the college curriculum.
