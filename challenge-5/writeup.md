This one was one of the most interesting questions. 
Here I learned about basic level sql injection that can be done to access unauthorized information in poorly designed websites.
This question however was not a basic one, it specifically banned the use of special symobls and the code had to be injected only via the password section. Opening the php file also required some prerequisite knowledge and softwares like xampp. 
Eventhough at first I didnt understand how it worked, via google, youtube and chatgpt I learned how to open the file as a local host. 
Then the challenge was to ask the right question. 
But after some time I wasnt able to access the php properly and couldnt try more injection (I got the idea trying to brute force and guess the password length by using 1#,2#..etc also I understood I can use '||' instead of directly using the keyword 'or' which was banned).
I now have a basic understanding on how to apply the logic, just need more practise for which I am considering to do Portswigger after finishing Overthewire which I am currently working on to develop my linux command skills.
