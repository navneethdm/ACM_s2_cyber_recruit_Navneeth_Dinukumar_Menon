In this challenge I learned how to execute a python script from the command line, python then hosted a local HTTP server in which I was able to complete the story mode. 
Syntax to open the python script - python file.py. 
Eventhough I completed the story with a score of 100, I wasn't able to find the flag, but I did learn how to work with a python script.
